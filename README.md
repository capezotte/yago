# YAGO (Jacob in Spanish)

Overlay containing ebuilds I use in my system. Mostly fixes for musl and FFMpeg 5.

Rebooted because the repo was in seriously bad shape due to months of neglecting QA. Not knowing about `repoman`/`pkgcheck` didn't help.

I dropped some ebuilds I no longer use (I've replaced nldev/smdev with mdevd, for instance). If you're interested, they can be found in the `master-old` branch.
