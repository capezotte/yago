# YAGO (Jacob in Spanish)

Yet another gentoo overlay.

Contains nldev and smdev for a no-udev install and pam\_rundir from Anopa/Artix so apps hardcoded to use /run/user/$UID don't cry when elogind is not available.

While I hope it works (and it works on my machine), I have to include the following all caps warning:
